#### Multi-dimensional arrays

By using the in-context directive, you can access multi-dimensional arrays.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#a}}
  {{a}} => {{#a}}{{.}} {{/a}}<br />
{{/a}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{a: [[0,1], [2,3], []]}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
[0,1] => 1
[2,3] => 2 3
[] =>
```

The tag before the `=>` prints the raw array value. As this is within a repeating section, the value is evaluated for each iterated item of the array (not the top-level array 'a' itself). 

After the `=>` we further enter that item as another section -- in this case a repeating section with the context shifted to second-level of the array. The naked-context tag inside this section is now referencing each inner array's value.

Note that in the first line, after the split, "0" is not printed as the default behavior is to treat zero-values as false, hence skipping that iteration of the repeating section (an example where we would want to [treat 0-values as true](../sections/#treating-zero-values-as-true)). And in the third line, nothing prints after the split since the array is empty.

&nbsp; 

We also could use all naked-context tags. The below template produces the same output. 

```
{{#a}}
  {{.}} => {{#.}}{{.}} {{/.}}<br />
{{/a}}
```

Which format looks better is up to the user.

&nbsp;

#### Arrays of functions

You can supply an array of functions for a repeating section. In the below example, not only is this done to cycle through three functions, but it is combined with the pass-context-to-function.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#people}}
  {{#funcs}}
    {{people->funcs}}
  {{/funcs}}
  <br />
{{/people}} 
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  people: [ 
    {
      name: {first: "Linda", last: "Belcher"}, 
      friendly: true
    }, 
    {
      name: {first: "Teddy", last: ""}, 
      friendly: true
    }, 
    {
      name: {first: "Jimmy", last: "Pesto"}, 
      friendly: false
    } 
  ], 
  funcs: [
    function() {
      if(!this.name) return 1;
      return this.name.first + " " + this.name.last + "<br />";
    }, 
    function() {
      if(!this.name) return 1;
      return this.name.last === "Belcher" ? "- is family<br />" : "";
    }, 
    function() {
      if(!this.name) return 1;
      return this.friendly ? "- is a friend<br />" : "";
    }
  ]
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Linda Belcher
- is family
- is a friend

Teddy
- is a friend

Jimmy Pesto

```

Note however that the above functions only make sense within the context of an item in `people`. Thus the if-statements returning 1 were added to each to protect against an error when traversing into an undefined property of the context. Because the functions are never used in the template outside the context of an item in `people`, the resulting "1" value is never printed. 

*However* these functions are evaluated in the repeating section `{{#func}}`, using the raw context (in this case resolving to the root binding), wherein the if-statements do come into play. If the if-statements returned false (or 0 or whitespace), they would be excluded from the repeating section render. Thus they must return a truthy value (or 0 with [the option to treat zero-values as true](../sections/#treating-zero-values-as-true)).

&nbsp;

#### Directives in chained functions

When chaining functions, each function key is separately considered, so it is allowed to use the in-context directive (`.`) and formatting directives within individual functions called in the chain.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#belchers.children}}
  {{#functions}}
    {{belchers.children->.fullname::capitalize->.label}}
  {{/functions}}
  <br />
{{/belchers.children}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  belchers: {
    familyName: "belcher", 
    children: [
      {name: "tina"}, 
      {name: "gene"}, 
      {name: "louise"}
    ]
  }, 
  i: 0, 
  alphabet: ['a', 'b', 'c'], 
  functions: {
    label: function(root) {
      return root.alphabet[root.i++] + ". " + this;
    }, 
    fullname: function(root) {
      return this.name + " " + root.belchers.familyName;
    }
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
a. Tina Belcher
b. Gene Belcher
c. Louise Belcher
```

&nbsp;

The functions `fullname` and `label` are called via shorthand with the in-context directive as they are within the section for `#functions`. Note that the value (passed as context) for `belchers.children` could be accessed via a naked in-context directive when directly under it's own section, however, it loses the context in the inner section for `#functions`, as the context for a tag refers to the most-direct section parent.

The format directive for word capitalization, because it comes after calling `fullname`, does not capitalize the labels, because labeling happens further down the chain.

&nbsp;

Any part of the chain that has a format directive will be converted into a string â€“ even if the directive doesn't really result in any apparent change to the value. If this is not considered when passed to a function down the chain, this may result in unexpected behavior or in the function failing.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{value->addTen::encode}}<br />
{{value::encode->addTen}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  value: 1, 
  addTen: function() { return this+10; }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
11
110
```

&nbsp;

#### Passing a function to itself

When passing a function as a context to itself, the function will first be evaluated as-is until it returns a valid context (that is, a non-function), then pass to itself as a function. Normally, this is kind of pointless or results in weird behavior, but it might be worth knowing as an edge case.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
1. {{&removeFirst.list}}<br />
2. {{&removeFirst->removeFirst}}<br />
3. {{#removeFirst->removeFirst}}{{&.list}}{{/removeFirst}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  list: ["one", "two", "three", "four"], 
  removeFirst: function() {
    return {list: this.list.slice(1)};
  } 
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
1. two, three, and four
2. {"list":["three","four"]}
3. three and four
```

Line 1 calls `removeFirst` which returns an object it can render `list` from. 

Line 2 takes the object returned from `removeFirst` when called, then uses it as a context to call the function again, which removes another item. However, we can't access the property `list` in the template. Adding dot-notation to this tag (e.g. `{{removeFirst->removeFirst.list}}`) would be interpreted as trying to find a function called `removeFirst.list`, which returns an array and would thus raise an exception as a context was passed to a non-function. Hence while the object returned is `{list: ["three", "four"]}` which is printed as is.

Line 3 works around this by using the output into a section, then using the section context to access the data in the context with another tag (which is covered in [the following section](#mixing-directives-in-a-section-tag)).

&nbsp; 

#### Mixing directives in a section tag

Section tags may have in-context or pass-to-function directives. This will resolve automatically and, in the latter case, ensure the data context is what results from the opening section tag. 

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#burger}}
  Available toppings:<br />
  {{#.toppings}}{{spacer}}- {{.}}<br />{{/.toppings}}
{{/burger}} 
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  spacer: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",
  burger: {
    toppings: ["cheese", "onions", "lettuce", "tomato"]
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Available toppings:
    - cheese
    - onions
    - lettuce
    - tomato
```

&nbsp;

Ensure when using in-context directives as section tags that the closing tag appears *exactly* as shown in the opening tag. The below template would result in an error, even if the section tags refer to the same binding.

```
{{#burger}}
  Available toppings:<br />
  {{#.toppings}}{{spacer}}- {{.}}<br />{{/burger.toppings}}
{{/burger}} 
```

&nbsp;

When using a context-passed-to-function as the section tag, this will create the appropriate dynamic context for any tags with in-context directives directly inside this section. Note that the closing tag does not need to mimic the pass-to-function part of the opening tag.

```
{{#burger}}
  Available add-ons:<br />
  {{#.addons->withPrices}}
    {{spacer}}- {{.name}} +{{.price::$.2f}}<br />
  {{/.addons}}
{{/burger}} 
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  spacer: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",
  burger: {
    addons: ["cheese", "bacon", "avocado"]
  }, 
  prices: { 
    cheese: 0.5, 
    bacon: 2, 
    avocado: 1.5
  }, 
  withPrices: function(root) {
    return this.map(name => ({
      name: name, 
      price: root.prices[name]
    }));
  }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
Available add-ons:
    - cheese +$0.50
    - bacon +$2.00
    - avocado +$1.50
```

&nbsp;

#### Function evaluation and modifying binding data

**DO NOT DO THIS** and here's why. Along with the caching issue ([covered in the function section](../functions/#function-evaluation-and-caching)), Templatize takes some optimization strategies to render the template with the least amount of work. While it takes certain edge cases to cause quirks from this strategy to become pronounced, when it does it can appear very unpredictable.

Templatize first renders normal sections from the outside-in. Thus, if a section is not to be displayed, it can skip the section entirely and avoiding unnecessary computation on any of the inner content. Certain types of tags are not processed in the first pass. (E.g. repeating sections are superficially handled, rendering only the tags within that are not bound to the repeating data, but not yet handling iteration of the content.) Templatize then renders all remaining tags not yet processed from the inside-out. This includes sections passed as context (as they require the inner content to be rendered first) and the repetition of repeating sections. This ensures that nested repeating sections are rendered in a way that minimizes number of iterations and redundant render computations.

In the below example, the content of arrays `outer` and `inner` do not matter except just to induce iterations, and the `count` function is always passed to a context to force re-evaluation.

&nbsp; *Template:*

```
{{#outer}}
  {{#section}}
    {{.->count}}
  {{/section}}
  -
  {{.->count}}
  -
  {{#inner}}
    {{.->count}}
  {{/inner}}
  <br />
{{/outer}}
```

&nbsp; *Bindings:*

```javascript
{
  i: 0, 
  outer: [1,2,3], 
  inner: [1,2], 
  section: true, 
  count: function(root) { return ++root.i; }
}
```

&nbsp; *Outputs:*

```
1 - 4 - 2 3
1 - 7 - 5 6
1 - 10 - 8 9
```

Because the context differs within the nested sections, context affects when each `{{.->count}}` tag gets rendered. Essentially, the numbers output represent the order in which each `{{.->count}}` tag was rendered. With repeated values meaning the tag was rendered once at that time, then later just duplicated as text.

In the first, outside-in pass, the `{{#section}}` section and the call to `count` inside it are handled, first putting the value of '1' as the first part of the `{{#outer}}` repeating section, thus with this number repeats with each line. It can be rendered on the first pass because here the context (`.`) is bound to data for `section`, which is not dynamic. The other calls to `count` require data bound to the repeating sections since the contexts in each are now the iterating data of `outer` or `inner`. So these tag are not rendered in this first pass.

On the second pass, the repeating sections are rendered. Because the second pass renders from the inside out, the `{{#inner}}` section is rendered first, evaluating the inner calls to `count` there, then the outer call to `count` next, even if it occurs before the inner section. Hence, for each row, the middle number between the hyphens is actually rendered after (thus greater in value than) the last two numbers.

I'm sure someone could construe a scenario in which this pattern could be taken advantage of, but it's hard to imagine. Thus as a general rule, **avoid functions that modifying the data bindings or return different values depending on the number of times called.**
